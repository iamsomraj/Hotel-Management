# Web Based Hotel Management System

This repository contains a very basic Web Based Hotel Management System , developed by a team of 4. This project is mainly developed in HTML , CSS and JavaScript. I used Bootstrap to create the frontend and the backend is developed in PHP.  The search requests in this system are implemented with the help of AJAX and the financial graphs are implemented using ChartJs.
